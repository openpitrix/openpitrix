# Development Guide

This document walks you through how to get started developing OpenPitrix and development workflow.

## Preparing the environment

### Go

OpenPitrix is written in [Go](http://golang.org/),use docker to build project.You can look for Dockerfile for builer in directory 'openpitrix/build/builder-docker',
you can set goproxy='https://goproxy.cn',when downloading go package timeout.


### Dependency management

OpenPitrix uses go module to manage dependencies [Go Module](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules).


### Test
You can build your images and set your image to openpitrix-hyperpitrix-deployment in kubesphere cluster

## Development Workflow

### 1 Fork in the github

1. Visit https://github.com/openpitrix/openpitrix
2. Click `Fork` button to establish a cloud-based fork.

### 2 Clone fork to local storage

1. Clone openpitrix locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/$user/openpitrix.git
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/openpitrix/openpitrix.git

# Never push to upstream master
$ git remote set-url --push upstream no_push

# Confirm that your remotes make sense:
$ git remote -v
```

### 3 Keep your branch in sync

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git rebase upstream/master
```

### 4 Add new features or fix issues

Branch from it:

```bash
$ git checkout -b myfeature
```

Then edit code on the myfeature branch.

**Run and test**

```bash
$ make build
$ make compose-up
$ make test

```

Run `make help` for additional information on these make targets.

### 5 Development in new branch

**Sync with upstream**

After the test is completed, suggest you to keep your local in sync with upstream which can avoid conflicts.

```
# Rebase your the master branch of your local repo.
$ git checkout master
$ git rebase upstream/master

# Then make your development branch in sync with master branch
git checkout new_feature
git rebase -i master
```
**Commit local changes**

```bash
$ git add <file>
$ git commit -s -m "add your description"
```

### 6 Push to your fork

When ready to review (or just to establish an offsite backup or your work), push your branch to your fork on github.com:

```
$ git push -f ${your_remote_name} myfeature
```

### 7 Create a PR

- Visit your fork at https://github.com/$user/openpitrix
- Click the` Compare & Pull Request` button next to your myfeature branch.
- Check out the [pull request process](pull-request.md) for more details and advice.


## CI/CD

OpenPitrix uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) as a CI/CD tool.

The components of OpenPitrix under `/cmd` folder need to be compiled and build include following:

After your PR is mergedï¼ŒTravis CI will compile the entire project and build the image, and push the image `openpitrix/[component-name]:latest` to Dockerhub (e.g. `openpitrix/openpitrix-api-gateway:latest`)

## Code conventions

Please reference [Code conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/coding-conventions.md) and follow with the rules.

**Note:**

> - All new packages and most new significant functionality must come with unit tests
> - Comment your code in English, see [Go's commenting conventions
